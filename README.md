Xml2Json-Parser
====

###Why?

Project I am about to start working on is predominantly using Xml in it's web services. As I prefer JSON myself I decided it would be easier to understand the required data structures if they are in JSON format.

Why not! It's just easier to read!!

###Prerequisites

+ You must have your xml files in a directory labelled, you guessed it xml at the root of your project.

Xml2Json-Parser

###Why?

Project I am about to start working on is predominantly using Xml in it's web services. As I prefer JSON myself I decided it would be easier to understand the required data structures if they are in JSON format. 

Why not! It's just easier to read!!

###Prerequisites

+ You must have your xml files in a directory labelled, you guessed it ```xml``` at the root of your project.
+ before running script via command line or requiring, please create a ```json``` directory at root of project also, for the parsed files to write too.

** I intend to update this little project so the above prerequisites do not apply, but unfortunately for the time being they do.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve please feel free to request a pull request.
